    <h1>Weekly 4 (but actually Weekly 2)</h1>
    <p>I felt that this film was both eye opening and confusing all at once. Ayn Rand’s philosophy seemed to weave in and out of focus as the film explored historical, cultural, and economic events (but not in chronological order). Ayn Rand’s philosophy is very relevant today though, as it was and is an influential informant of American culture. It was a historical ideological foundation in Silicon Valley, as the movie talks about, and now Silicon Valley is one of the most powerful economic hubs of the world. Global industries have followed in Silicon Valley’s footsteps, and unspoken but ever present are core aspects of the trade that consider Rand’s beliefs. Capitalism as we know it has grown out of her anti-altruist tenants, and corporations continue to consider only their own needs and growth and exploit others.

    <h1>Weekly 5</h1>
    <p>I think cybernetics is a useful tool for learning more about reality, but I wouldn’t call it a foolproof, accurate method of describing reality. It’s true that many aspects of the world function as systems - the environment, weather, the water, carbon, and nitrogen cycles, the political systems we create, systems of communication and cultural dissemination - I could go on and on. But these systems, as the movie explained, can’t be reduced or simplified, even with the help of computers. Ultimately, things are complex beyond our understanding and we shouldn’t rely on our or even our computers’ ability to correctly determine every factor and its exact influence on other factors of a system.

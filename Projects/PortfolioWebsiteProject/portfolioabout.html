A digital media producer by trade, I aspire to work at the intersection of art and science, sharing my ideas and passions with others. I’m especially interested in projects that blend educational or research content with aesthetic, emotion, and entertainment value to make complex topics accessible and inspiring for all.
            <br> <br>
            I want to explore our reality and learn everything I can about the way the world works; that’s why I love both the sciences and the arts. To me, science is a beautifully rational process of discovering the fundamental truths of the universe, while art is an expression of our personal and societal truths. It’s our way of reflecting upon ourselves, and as Sean Carroll says,
            “We are part of the universe that has developed a remarkable ability: We can hold an image of the world in our minds. We are matter contemplating itself.”

      <h2>Hito Steyerl: In Defense of the Poor Image</h2>
      <p>
In Steyerl’s piece, the poor image is fast and low quality. The relevance of the poor image is transient - perhaps I’m wrong, but my understanding is that memes are the most modern version of the poor image. Memes don’t last long - they’re always refreshing, always shifting, always being reedited, recirculated, reinterpretted. Memes circulate at a high speed across the globe, and they gain and lose popularity in quick flashes. Digital images with high resolution are usually considered “slow” speeds. This doesn’t always mean that they’re longer in time, but perhaps that they last longer. Feature films, for example, tend to stay within cultural memory for longer than one specific meme.

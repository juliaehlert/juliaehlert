    <h1>Weekly 6: Foucault</h1>
    <p>To be honest, the first time I tried to listen to this podcast episode, I fell asleep. But the second time, I didn't, and I enjoyed the end so much that I even shared a link to it on Facebook! I agree with many of Foucault's ideas. It seems both logical and true that the three prongs of power: surveillance, naturalization, and examination exist outside of just the penal system, but have invaded our societal reality. I agree that we all act as both surveiller and surveilled, and that we strive to conform in order to feel successful and be recognized as normal. I'm not sure how convinced I am that those who hold knowledge are the truly powerful though. Sure, those who establish our agreed upon versions of understanding reality do have a sway over those with political and economic power. But I'm not sure that truth and knowledge are appropriately represented and have higher swaying power over the world than money and politics. The reality is that people with money may ascribe to knowledge or belief systems that aren't true, or that have a smaller following. Those rich people then use their wealth to disproportionately spread that false knowledge. In that instance, money has power over scientific knowledge. I think that's the way things have been going as of late, with anti-vaxxers and climate change deniers being prime case studies. Political and economic power distorts the power of knowledge.

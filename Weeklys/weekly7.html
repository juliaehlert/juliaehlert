    <h1>Weekly 7: Postscript on the Societies of Control</h1>
    <p>This piece, “Postscript on the Societies of Control” is a bit hard to follow since it is talking about something I haven’t read. But it discusses the ways we think about society - how we divide our spaces of existence up, how we shift between these divisions. At first, there were disciplinary societies, divided into imaginary enclosures with different functions. Then, the subsequent theory divided up societies of control, looking beyond functional divisions and elaborating on the systems of power. This closely relates to Foucault, because he explores the themes of power and control and the different relationships they have, patterns and rules they follow, etc. “Liberating and enslaving forces confront each other,” within the societies of control, and Foucault postulated the ubiquity of these systems of power.</p>
